# Advent Calendar


#### Leon Fr√∂hlich, Robin Seidel, Patrick Beer, Simon Streuli

To get started on our project, three of us made a sketch of they imagined the webpage to look like. This was motivated by the fact, that it was hard to get started without any idea and many questions first arise when things become concrete. As they say, a prototype is worth more, than a 1000 meetings.
